3. **Conflict Resolution**: The system will automatically detect and prevent double bookings or scheduling conflicts, ensuring that no two meetings overlap in the same room.

4. **Modification and Cancellation**: Users will have the ability to modify or cancel their reservations, with the system automatically updating the room's availability status.

5. **Notifications and Reminders**: The system can send automated notifications and reminders to users about upcoming meetings, changes in reservations, or other relevant updates.

6. **Reporting and Analytics**: Administrators will have access to reports and analytics on room usage, helping optimize resource allocation and identify patterns in room utilization.
